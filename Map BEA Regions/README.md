These are the BEA Geographic Area definitions as defined circa July 2025. 

The region .pdf comes from a footnote found in the BEA Global Value Chains technical document on Trade in Value Added (TiVA)  Statistics [https://www.bea.gov/sites/default/files/2021-12/technical-document-methodology-for-preparing-single-country-trade-in-value-added-statistics_0.pdf]

This is the sheet: "https://apps.bea.gov/international/bp_web/geographic_area_definitions.pdf"


This is not a particularly helpful format for most practitioners. I provide the data in .csv format with a number of country features.
